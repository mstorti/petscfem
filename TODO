TODO: [Mainly fixes go here...]
=====

* Add `sw_abso' to tests
* Doesn't report correctly acesses to the last thash table, probably 
	  related to the weights flag. (Reported by
	  psanchez@intec.unl.edu.ar) Wed, 15 Oct 2003 09:12:34 -0300
* dx/epimport.cpp deletes too many objects and DX complains
* Print a banner saying if a version is stable/unstable. 
* Let PETSc-FEM have knowledge of the name of the nodes 
* verify `nsid.cpp' (ns_id_fac*ns_id_cn1) and `lumped_vc'
* replace epart2 -> epart in readmesh.cpp and other parts of elemset,
     etc... 
* Pass fix to `ns.cpp' (define MPI_RANK *before* `print_copyright') to
      stable 3.22
* Make user can call PETSc-FEM assert call abort() or exit(). 
* Check caching DX objects for multiple elemsets
* Code and test changing coords and elemset conectivities 
  caching by the user/ appl. writer. 
* `src/secant.cpp' is compiled differently. why?
* Make a test for Newton convergence with ns_id and lag_mul mixed. 
* Correct DOC++ doc in `lagmul.h'
* why `make finaldoc' in ./ doesn't launch latex2html?
* FastMat2 doesn't detect errors like this
  `tmp5.prod(dshapex,tmp4,-1,2,-1,2);' i.e. the free indices are not
  in a sequence starting at 1. (see fstepfm.cpp, Fri Jul 26
  12:51:27 ART 2002). non contracted indices should be 1,2,.... 
  neither this: tmp11.prod(dshapex,tmp12,-1,1,-1);
* default values for npg
* DX: lets to call field generators from dynamically load C/C++
         modules. 
* DX: make `dxhook' to be launched through a flag of type `dx' not
          through the standard `hook-list' option line. 
* DX: check for memory leaks, both in `epimport.cpp' and in  petscfem
          itself. 
* Convert all `assert()' macros to a PETSCFEM_ASSERT or similar. 
* Why it takes so much time after "Start partitioning" when running
    large problems in one proc.
* Generate test for LES 
* `html' target in `doc' is duplicated and `make' complains. 
* Add a test for advdif with null weight processor
* Add edge weights to graph partitioning in `metisprt.cpp'
* Make `report_consumed_time' to report the time spent in computing
        residues, and assembly. 
* Document new options for IISDMat
* In `eperlini.pl' we have to check strings/number with `is_numeric()'
   defined in 'perl/utils.pl' but this requires to update eperl in
   spider. 
* There is a problem with the `fstack' close and destruction
  functions. It gives a SIGSEGV for the following version of rosi2/pfm
> ----------
> tag: v0.08.pl58 on Tue, 11 Jun 2002 21:05:52 -0300 by mstorti in spider
>      > Reads data from initialization files
* Add test for axisymmetric option in nsi_tet_les_fm2
* generate tests for gatherer
* generate a test for Levi-Civita (eps_LC())
* Make dof map to a `fixation_entry_list', that contains many entries
    of the form (double,Amplitude) so that we can have an Amplitude
    function that is a sum of several Amplitude functions. 
* Make advdif not to need the CHECK_JAC compilation flag, so that it
     doesn't need recompilation to check the jacobian. 
* Continuation lines behave extrangely when ending in a comment. For
	instance: 
  blah blah blah blah \
    blah blah blah \
	blah blah # comment
   See ROCKET `slosh.epl' example Thu Feb 28 09:11:50 ART 2002
* Fix `delete' and `new' not balanced in `NewAdvDifFF' derived
         classes.

* write doc for Sparse::Mat, IISD with SuperLU local solver. 
* put `const A' in the argument to PFMat::duplicate
* interface preconditioning for IISD
* Put order in the headers. Now, a modification in some header launchs
    recompilation of almost the whole code. 
* make `da' in profiles to be dimensioned of size `neqp' (number of
   dofs in local processor, not of size `neq' (number of total dofs)
* write better error messages in FM2 (with threads??)
* new scheduling algorithm for load balancing in `elemset.cpp'
* adapt generic non-linear restriction element to general case
    (arbitrary argument list)
* fix some incompatibilities that exclude compilation with LES under old RH5.2
         of some STL vector usage.
* Dofmap may be eliminated of the arguments to the elemset 'assemble'
     routine (not from the global assemble)
* classify sections in doc as user / application developper / programmer.
* Review impact of '-funroll-loops' in FastMat2 efficiency. 
* Make ElementIterator a nested class of Elemset
* Convert flux functions (burgers, shallow water), to new ff's...
* In the advective elemsets we don't destroy the flux function objects
     created for instance in 
        `newadvdif_burgers() : NewAdvDif(new burgers_ff(this)) {};'
* make __INCLUDE__ can accept "" enclosed strings
* Throw an error if nothing is read (a void file).
* Check headers for functions (the __FUNC__ macro). 
* A faster (cached version) of mydet and mydetsur
* Fix makefile: runs bison and compiles getarray.cpp even if it's not
  necessary
* document coding of fastmat2. Document the eperl utilities.
* Should State have a TimeData instead of a Time
* Why not to do a single loop over node_list in the print_some()
       routines?  
* Check for memory leaks in constructing and destructing filters.
* sqcav and burgers test
* Document sttfilter etc...
* Document the element locker feature
* Fix problems with b.c.'s when Dirichlet and periodic superimposed. 
* Making html doc, doesn't reuse the generated gifs, which is _very_
           time consuming.

DONE:
=====

* in `./Makefile' local_sw: should FIRST do `chmod 755'
* a dynamically loaded Gauss Point adaptor elemset. 
* revert changes for locker in adaptor, etc...
* Crashes with SEGV if input file is void (should complain and abort). 
* FIXED: Grows indefinitely in memory if a `fixa' section is not closed by
    the corresponding __END_FIXA__
* Make VERSION to have a newline at the end of line so as to be a
           regular Unix text file.
* Generate a summary of `odoc' options in the doc with `odoc.pl'. 
* Generate a test for exception handling in `advdif'. 
* Convert negative jacobian errors in advdif to set_error. 
* DX: make epimport.cpp to print shapes in one line. 
* Seems that can't correctly read elements with 1 node. STATUS:
	 fixed. 
* put dependency of `compdate.cpp' on `compdate.cppin' in the
      Makefiles. STATUS: discarded. 
* Can't read element lines with only one node with one digit
* Generate a test for the disconnected graph bug. 
* Add `wiki' syntax to //o options (#tt#, *bf*, _em_ ...)
* Make PETSCFEM_ASSERT not to print a dot in the message i.e. "condition." 
* document wiki syntax for `odoc.pl'
* print the date of running on the start
* OK Write a `system' hook. (executes a shell command). 
* DX: let the user to dynamically split fields in scalar, vectors, etc...
* if it can't open the connectivity file, it hangs with a SIGSEGV
  write test. FIXED
* DX: Make a hook class for generating fields directly from
          PETSc-FEM. 
* change 2002 -> 2003 everywhere
* DX: make `dxhook' to auto-recognize geometries from the "geometry"
          option and dimensionality. 
* DX: test splitting with triangles
* DX: Code asynchronous visualization with threads. 
* DX: write documentation for `dx_hook' and `ExtProgImport'. 
* DX: check runs auto with sequencer

           other with all the arrays
* DX: Delete comments in `epimport.cpp'
* Generate test for SuperLU implementation. 
* Use lapack lib for `daxpy' in `test/Makefile:testfm2d'
* recover test `thash2.cpp'
* Changing 'distmap.h' launches recompilation of almost all
   PETSc-FEM. 
* int FastMat2: `mydetsur' with masks can't be cached (loses cached
      dims and claims dimensioning errors. See version "tag:
      beta-3.02.pl11 on Wed, 7 Aug 2002 16:31:37 -0300 by mstorti in
      minerva.arcride.edu.ar"
* A line like this: ' __INCLUDE__ cylinder.bott_no_slip.tmp' causes a
  SIGSEGV (note the line starts with a space). 
  Fix. See ROCKET/ident -D 'Sun, 14 Apr 2002 16:37:51 -0300'
  NOW: gives error. 
* the name for the elemsets doesn't accept the quotes "name" feature
   (see readmesh.cpp:191). NOW: read with `get_string'.
* latex2html doesn't work with `algorithmic' environment. 
	FIXED:      Latex2html doesn't like the `algorithm' (it is like a figure
     environment) environment, but DO support the `algorithmic'
     environment. Eliminated the `algorithm' environment in `doc/nsdoc.tex'. 
* latex2html should put the section number in the title (eg. section
        5.3)... 
* FIx in documentation, can't call environment `algorightm'. 
* Write a script that retrieves date corresponding to a light tag
          Sol: Use date in tag replacing `ART' or `ARST' by `-0300'

   very much gain: At most a 10%. 
* Write tests for `Graph' class
* In `ns.cpp' it seems that there is no convergence check on the
  internal Newton loop. 
* Use IISD `inside processors'.
