TODO: [Mainly fixes go here...]
=====

* fix the __VA_ARG__ incompatibility with older cpp (???)
* generar doc en .pdf
* Dofmap may be eliminated of the arguments to the elemset 'assemble'
     routine (not from the global assemble)
* classify sections in doc as user / application developper / programmer.
* Add enthalpy contrib to the P_supg term
* Review impact of '-funroll-loops' in FastMat2 efficiency. 
* add doc for enthalpy jacobians
* replace all  VOID_IT by clear()
* Make ElementIterator a nested class of Elemset
* Convert flux functions (burgers, shallow water), to new ff's...
* Add a "mass" to the advective dffusive eq.??
* In the advective elemsets we don't destroy the flux function objects
     created for instance in 
        `newadvdif_burgers() : NewAdvDif(new burgers_ff(this)) {};'
* Add weak_form support to the new flux functions
* Write a test for linear advection diffusion
* Include an S_body for ffadvfm2
* Add doc for new flux functions
* make __INCLUDE__ can accept "" enclosed strings
* Throw an error if nothing is read (a void file).
* Write a norm_p function (like sum_square_all...)
* Check headers for functions (the __FUNC__ macro). 
* A faster (cached version) of mydet and mydetsur
* Fix makefile: runs bison and compiles getarray.cpp even it's not
  necessary
* document coding of fastmat2. Document the eperl utilities.
* write diag-like fastmat2 functions. 
* Make readmesh check dof numbers not being greater than... 
* test for burgers
* move 'awatch' from test/
* add wall laws to turbulent shallow water
* Should State have a TimeData instead of a Time
* Why not to do a single loop over node_list in the print_some()
       routines?  
* Check for memory leaks in constructing and destructing filters.
* sqcav and burgers test
* Document sttfilter etc...
* Document the element locker feature
* Fix problems with b.c.'s when Dirichlet and periodic superimposed. 
* Making html doc, doesn't reuse the generated gifs, which is very
           time consuming.


DONE:
=====

* the link to DOC++ in index.tex is broken
* Cambiar la licencia en todos los archivos
* How to choose the correct jacobian when different combinations (eg:
    ndim*ndim, ndof, etc...) coincide...
* corregir normales en mydetsur y otros ... 
* Add options for turbulent shallow water
* Fix error while opening data file, when no case gives
           "Couldn't open file "^&*&^*&^ <garbage> *^%&^()#*$"!!
* Add targets to the Makefile like `distrib' `almost_clean' etc...
* Find a better hash function for the text hashes. 
* Put `const' keyword in `get_entry' and friends.
* ffswfm2t test
