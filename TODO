TODO: [Mainly fixes go here...]
=====

* In advdif, make `CHECK_JAC' to be an option to be read from the data
    file at run time. 
* When using `ndim=2' in global options and 'ndim=3' in an elemset
   some things go wrong. (reported by Beto).
* Set `node=nel-2' in nonlres.cpp:250?
* Read  `sqcav', `cubcav', `pfmat2' to test/Makefile
* USE_DX should be tied to USE_PTHREADS. Also it gives an error with
    `make depend' if DXARCH is not set and USE_SSL is set (Or
    something like that). 
* make `epsilon' relative in `srfgath' 
* `advdif/id' elemset does some `proj' task or something. We should write
    an `ask' function for it. 
* Add `start_step' feature. 
* List grants in doc
* Add `dataflow.obj' to doc.
* Let `upload_vector_fast' to have several masks with integer values,
    e.g. [1 1 1 0 0; 1 1 1 0 0; 1 1 1 2 2; 0 0 2 2 2; 0 0 2 2 2]
* Finish completing_read with petscfem_options
* There is a conflict between the computation of residual jacobians 
	  in advdif and the use of masks/profiles for element
	  uploading. 
* Sends multiple messages (from all processors) when can't open file
    in 
    > Couldn't open file "spillwgc.bcconv-all.tmp"!!
    > Couldn't open file "spillwgc.bcconv-all.tmp"!!
    > Assertion failed: "ierr==0"
    > Couldn't find __END_ELEMSET__ tag
    Sat, 06 Dec 2003 13:15:41 -0300: Can't reproduce
* Check the `advdif/bcconv' elemset in 3D. Seems that there is a sign
     problem. 
  Mon, 08 Dec 2003 08:56:00 -0300: See discussion and patch in
     `notes.txt'. Patch is not applied yet, though. 
* Doesn't report correctly acesses to the last thash table, probably 
	  related to the weights flag. (Reported by
	  psanchez@intec.unl.edu.ar) Wed, 15 Oct 2003 09:12:34 -0300
    Mon, 08 Dec 2003 09:51:12 -0300: Can't reproduce
* Document the element locker feature
* Using DX cache. dx/epimport.cpp deletes too many objects and DX
    complains. Also is hangs frequently. 
* Print a banner saying if a version is stable/unstable. 
* Let PETSc-FEM have knowledge of the name of the nodes 
* verify `nsid.cpp' (ns_id_fac*ns_id_cn1) and `lumped_vc'
* replace epart2 -> epart in readmesh.cpp and other parts of elemset,
     etc... 
* Pass fix to `ns.cpp' (define MPI_RANK *before* `print_copyright') to
      stable 3.22
* Make user can call PETSc-FEM assert call abort() or exit(). 
* Check caching DX objects for multiple elemsets
* Code and test changing coords and elemset conectivities 
  caching by the user/ appl. writer. 
* `src/secant.cpp' is compiled differently. why?
* Make a test for Newton convergence with ns_id and lag_mul mixed. 
* Correct DOC++ doc in `lagmul.h'
* why `make finaldoc' in ./ doesn't launch latex2html?
* FastMat2 doesn't detect errors like this
  `tmp5.prod(dshapex,tmp4,-1,2,-1,2);' i.e. the free indices are not
  in a sequence starting at 1. (see fstepfm.cpp, Fri Jul 26
  12:51:27 ART 2002). non contracted indices should be 1,2,.... 
  neither this: tmp11.prod(dshapex,tmp12,-1,1,-1);
* default values for npg
* DX: lets to call field generators from dynamically load C/C++
         modules. 
* DX: make `dxhook' to be launched through a flag of type `dx' not
          through the standard `hook-list' option line. 
* DX: check for memory leaks, both in `epimport.cpp' and in  petscfem
          itself. 
* Convert all `assert()' macros to a PETSCFEM_ASSERT or similar. 
* Why it takes so much time after "Start partitioning" when running
    large problems in one proc.
* Generate test for LES 
* `html' target in `doc' is duplicated and `make' complains. 
* Add a test for advdif with null weight processor
* Add edge weights to graph partitioning in `metisprt.cpp'
* Make `report_consumed_time' to report the time spent in computing
        residues, and assembly. 
* Document new options for IISDMat
* In `eperlini.pl' we have to check strings/number with `is_numeric()'
   defined in 'perl/utils.pl' but this requires to update eperl in
   spider. 
* There is a problem with the `fstack' close and destruction
  functions. It gives a SIGSEGV for the following version of rosi2/pfm
> ----------
> tag: v0.08.pl58 on Tue, 11 Jun 2002 21:05:52 -0300 by mstorti in spider
>      > Reads data from initialization files
* Add test for axisymmetric option in nsi_tet_les_fm2
* generate tests for gatherer
* generate a test for Levi-Civita (eps_LC())
* Make dof map to a `fixation_entry_list', that contains many entries
    of the form (double,Amplitude) so that we can have an Amplitude
    function that is a sum of several Amplitude functions. 
* Make advdif not to need the CHECK_JAC compilation flag, so that it
     doesn't need recompilation to check the jacobian. 
* Continuation lines behave extrangely when ending in a comment. For
	instance: 
  blah blah blah blah \
    blah blah blah \
	blah blah # comment
   See ROCKET `slosh.epl' example Thu Feb 28 09:11:50 ART 2002
* Fix `delete' and `new' not balanced in `NewAdvDifFF' derived
         classes. 
* add tests  `cubcav' 
* Fix documentation. New version of latex2html screwed all up. 
* write doc for Sparse::Mat, IISD with SuperLU local solver. 
* put `const A' in the argument to PFMat::duplicate
* interface preconditioning for IISD
* Put order in the headers. Now, a modification in some header launchs
    recompilation of almost the whole code. 
* make `da' in profiles to be dimensioned of size `neqp' (number of
   dofs in local processor, not of size `neq' (number of total dofs)
* write better error messages in FM2 (with threads??)
* new scheduling algorithm for load balancing in `elemset.cpp'
* adapt generic non-linear restriction element to general case
    (arbitrary argument list)
* fix some incompatibilities that exclude compilation with LES under old RH5.2
         of some STL vector usage.
* Dofmap may be eliminated of the arguments to the elemset 'assemble'
     routine (not from the global assemble)
* classify sections in doc as user / application developper / programmer.
* Review impact of '-funroll-loops' in FastMat2 efficiency. 
* Make ElementIterator a nested class of Elemset
* Convert flux functions (burgers, shallow water), to new ff's...
* In the advective elemsets we don't destroy the flux function objects
     created for instance in 
        `newadvdif_burgers() : NewAdvDif(new burgers_ff(this)) {};'
* make __INCLUDE__ can accept "" enclosed strings
* Throw an error if nothing is read (a void file).
* Check headers for functions (the __FUNC__ macro). 
* A faster (cached version) of mydet and mydetsur
* Fix makefile: runs bison and compiles getarray.cpp even if it's not
  necessary
* document coding of fastmat2. Document the eperl utilities.
* Should State have a TimeData instead of a Time
* Why not to do a single loop over node_list in the print_some()
       routines?  
* Check for memory leaks in constructing and destructing filters.
* sqcav and burgers test
* Document sttfilter etc...
* Fix problems with b.c.'s when Dirichlet and periodic superimposed. 
* Making html doc, doesn't reuse the generated gifs, which is _very_
           time consuming.

################################################################

DONE:
=====

* Check that absorbing b.c.'a options are included in the doc. 
  DONE: they are added and now we have the papers. Sun Nov 13 20:28:32 2005
* In `FastMat2::is()' if the index is greater than the dimension of 
  the matrix, that index is discarded in the mask in place of throwing
  an error. Now I think that it should throw an error. 
  DONE: seems that has been fixed in 1.20 of `fastmat2.cpp'
  on  2005/05/02 00:35:12. But the bug was reported on aug 2005. 
* Add to FastMat2 documentation that maskes `ir()', `is()' should not
    traverse `branch()', `choose()' boundaries. 
  DONE: added a section. Sun Nov 13 20:21:30 2005
* When in dx-hook mode, it should not crash if the state file is not
  found. 
  > dx_hook: reading state from file curvjet.dx-state.tmp, record 0
  > dx_hook: Reading from formatted file.
  > dxhook.cpp:326: Can't read line.
  DONE:= now sends 0 if file is not found. Sun Nov 13 20:21:30 2005
* make `TextHashTable::add_entry()' warn _optionally_ when the
  entry for an old key is modified. Now warns always. 
  DONE: Sun Nov  6 13:01:11 2005
  Implemented, not very well tested though. 
* Lacks of preco_type=jacobi for FS in ns.cpp?
  Apparently fixed with the addition of `fractional_step_solver_combo'
  option. 
* when `fixa_amplitude' has no function name it givs segmentation
  violation. Ver `petyscfem-cases/gfabso-examples/gfabso.epl' 
  Tue Aug 23 11:45:09 2005. 
  FIXED: Sun Nov  6 11:52:25 2005
  Added controls to token, after calling strtok().
* Escape ! in options doc. For instance in line
  TGETOPTDEF(go,int,dx_state_all_fields,!dx_split_state_flag);
  in `dxhook.cpp'. It comes without the `d' in the PDF. 
  DONE: added escaping for `!'. Not well tested because all options
  in `odocall.tex' are not processed in the main documentation file
  `petscfem.pdf'. 
* Make `advdif' process hooks _before_ assembling profile and reading
  initial vector
  DONE: Sun Nov  6 10:09:37 2005. Simply moved code as for NS. Seems
  to work well. 
* When not using __INCLUDE__ in the constraint section (for instance)
      doesn't complain. (see version `beta-3.43.21'). 
> constraint
> gfshock.peri.tmp
> gfshock.v-peri.tmp
> gfshock.slip.tmp
> __END_CONSTRAINT__
  FIXED: Sun May  1 15:37:50 2005
	 Now gives error if can't read a token. 
* Apparently crashes when in the elemset section finds a string that
    is not elemset, for instance
> elemset qharmm 8
> conductivity 1.
> C 0.
> Cp 0.
> geometry cartesian3d
> name fluid

  Mon Feb 21 15:55:02 2005: FIXED
* Not reporting error in 
  parallel "Couldn't open file "../proy.skin.tmp"!!" while reading
  fixations.

* Fix warnings that are currently disabled with '-Wno-deprecated'
       Mon Feb 21 15:00:28 2005: Fixed, compiles OK without
       '-Wno-deprecated'. 
* Add test for `surf_gatherer' in test/cubcav. Apparently it is
       almost already done. 
       Sun Feb 20 21:37:22 2005: Added test
* Breaks uncleanly when include directive is pasted to filename, e.g. 
            __INCLUDE__xxxxxx.file ???

     OK Test gasflow_abso in 3D. 
     Test gasflow_abso with transverse component. 
     Test on a 2D geometry (bump, nozzle, flat plate?).

    NO, OK: the lacking file is an output file, so that it only gives
	 a `couldn't open' error.
