NAME
       iso2ident, ident2iso: encode/decode a string with alphanumeric charar­
       acters

SYNOPSIS
       Given a string `iso2ident' converts it to a string composed of only the
       `[a-zA-Z0-9_]' set (i.e. alphanumeric + `_'). Useful for encoding arbi­
       trary texts in filenames or identifiers. `ident2iso' does the inverse
       task.

DESCRIPTION
       Suppose you want to have files with names "case: a=0.2345; c=3.56;
       b=4.89e-15". You can do this in Unix but spaces and other characters
       may lead to problems. The problem is harder if you want identifiers
       for, say, `C', `Perl' or a similar language. This utility converts all
       characters different from the set `[a-zA-Z0-9]' to `_+hexcode', so that
       you end up with only characters in the set `[a-zA-Z0-9_]'.  Underscore
       acts as a 'escape character'.  Of course, the escape character has to
       be also encoded. The escape character may be changed by modifying the
       value of `$ESCAPE_CHAR'.

EXAMPLES
        $ iso2ident 'case: a=0.2345; c=3.56; b=4.89e-15'
        case_3a_20a_3d0_2e2345_3b_20c_3d3_2e56_3b_20b_3d4_2e89e_2d15
        $ ident2iso case_3a_20a_3d0_2e2345_3b_20c_3d3_2e56_3b_20b_3d4_2e89e_2d15
        case: a=0.2345; c=3.56; b=4.89e-15
        $
