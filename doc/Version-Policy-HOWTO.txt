These are the steps for saving a new stable version of PETSc-FEM. The
policy version herself is described in the doc. Say that we are
working in unstable version 3.21, stable 3.20 and want to save a new
stable version 3.22 (unstable 3.23)

*./ Save CVS repository (directory `cvsroot') in cvsroot-DATE.tgz
*./ Make $ make tag with version=3.23
*./ Make a branch tag starting on the newly created stable one with:
         $ cvs tag -b -r beta--3-23 beta--3-22
*./ Make a new directory in PETSC/ with the new stable release
    $ cvs co -d petscfem-beta-3.22 -r beta--3-22 petscfem
*./ In that directory replace 3.23 by 3.22 in files `stable.log' and
         `save.log' and commit. 
*./ Same in files on the HEAD branch (probably directory PETSC/petscfem)
*./ Create a new `light' administrative version on the `HEAD' branch
       with numbering 3.23.pl1 (WARNING: the script will suggest 3.22.pl1).
*./ Update `doc/versions-tree.fig'
