These are the steps for saving a new stable version of PETSc-FEM. The
policy version herself is described in the doc. Say that we are
working in unstable version 3.41, stable 3.40 and want to save a new
stable version 3.42 (unstable 3.43)

*./ Save CVS repository (directory `cvsroot') in cvsroot-DATE.tgz
*./ Make $ make tag with version=3.43
*./ Make a branch tag starting on the newly created stable one with:
         $ cvs tag -b -r beta--3-41 beta--3-40
*./ Make a new directory in PETSC/ with the new stable release
    $ cvs co -d petscfem-beta-3.42 -r beta--3-40 petscfem
*./ In that directory replace 3.43 by 3.42 in files `stable.log' and
         `save.log'. Set BOPT to O_c++ in Makefile.base. Commit. 
*./ Create a new administrative branch in the stable version
    (directory `petscfem-beta-3.42') with version `beta-3.42.1'. 
*./ Replace 3.43 by 3.42 in files `stable.log' and `save.log' on 
	    the HEAD branch (probably directory PETSC/petscfem)
*./ Create a new `light' administrative version on the `HEAD' branch
       with numbering 3.43.1 (WARNING: the script will suggest 3.42.1).
*./ Update `doc/versions-tree.fig'
*./ Probably compile programs in directory `petscfem-beta-3.42'
