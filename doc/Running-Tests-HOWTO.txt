* Be sure that the `BOPT' variable is not hardwired set in a
  tests/.../Makefile, since that way the test will not be done in the
  two optimization levels. 

* Run `make torture' in the `tests' directory. There remains two files 
  `make-tests-O_c++.log' and `make-tests-g_c++.log' that have the
  report for each mode. All the result of the rans remains tar-gzipped
  in `make-tests-O_c++.tar.gz' and `make-tests-g_c++.tar.gz' in the
  top directory. 

* If some test is not passed check what happened and run again.
