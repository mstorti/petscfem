\Section{Gatherers and embedded gatherers}

Typically \emph{``gatherers''} are reduction operators over the
element sets, i.e. instead of assembling a matrix or vector, the
gather operations produce some kind of global data, as for instance
%
\begin{itemize}
\compactlist 
\item The volume/surface/length of an elemset.
\item The integral of some quantity (fields, coordinates, or functions
  of the them) over the element set, for instance total concentration,
  total energy, total (linear or angular) momentum or angular
  momentum. 
\item Same as above but depending also on gradients of the state
  variables, for instance: total elastic energy. This involves some 
\item Same as above but integrals of quantities on a manifold of a
  dimension lower than the embedding space. In this case the integrand
  may involve also the normal to the surface, for instance total flow
  of heat or volume rate through a surface. 
\end{itemize}
