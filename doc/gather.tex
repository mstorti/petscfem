\Section{Gatherers and embedded gatherers}

Typically \emph{``gatherers''} are reduction operators over the
element sets, i.e. instead of assembling a matrix or vector, the
gather operations produce some kind of global data, as for instance
%
\begin{itemize}
\compactlist 
\item The volume/surface/length of an elemset.
\item The integral of some quantity (fields, coordinates, or functions
  of the them) over the element set, for instance total concentration,
  total energy, total (linear or angular) momentum or angular
  momentum. 
\item Same as above but depending also on gradients of the state
  variables, for instance: total elastic energy. This involves some 
\item Same as above but integrals of quantities on a manifold of a
  dimension lower than the embedding space. In this case the integrand
  may involve also the normal to the surface, for instance total flow
  of heat or volume rate through a surface. 
\end{itemize}
 
Gatherers are implemented as \verb+elemsets+ the only difference is
that they typically only process a special jobinfo named
\verb+gather+. This jobinfo is processed after the time step,
i.e. only after the Newton loop, on the converged values. This jobinfo
task does not assemble vectors or matrices, but a series global values
stored in a global C++ vector called
\verb+vector<int> gather_values+. A typical call is as follows (taken
from \verb+ns.cpp+),
%
\medskip
\begin{verbatim}
    arglf.clear();
    arglf.arg_add(&state,IN_VECTOR|USE_TIME_DATA);
    arglf.arg_add(&state_old,IN_VECTOR|USE_TIME_DATA);
    arglf.arg_add(&gather_values,VECTOR_ADD);
    ierr = assemble(mesh,arglf,dofmap,"gather",&time_star);
    CHKERRA(ierr);
\end{verbatim}
\medskip
%
Note that three arguments are passed to the \verb+gather+ assemble
task: the old and new states, and the vector of gathered values.

\subsection{Dimensioning the values vector} 

In order to use the gatherers the user must before dimension
appropriately the array of values with global option
\verb+ngather+. Then, for each gatherer elemset the user must set the
options that select a continuous range in this vector, namely
\verb+gather_pos+ and \verb+gather_length+. The selected range is
\verb|[gather_pos,gather_pos+gather_length]|. Then, for instance, if
the (hyopthetical) gatherer elemset \verb+momentum_integrator+ is
supposed to compute the integral of the momentum (a 3-vector in 3D),
then we could use as

\medskip
\begin{verbatim}
global_options
...
ngather 3
__END_HASH__



elemset momentum_integrator 4
...
gather_pos 0
gather_length 3
data ./
__END_HASH
\end{verbatim}
\medskip
 
With this setup, the program will compute for each time step the
integral of the momentum, at will print these three values on stadard
output. If a string is passed to the global option \verb+gather_file+
for instance
%
\medskip
\begin{verbatim}
...
ngather 3
gather_file momentum.out
...
\end{verbatim}
\medskip
%
then, instead of reporting the gathered values on standard output they
are printed on the corresponding file. The file is opened and closed
at each time step.

\subsection{Parallel aspects} 

Of course, PETSc-FEM is in charge of adding the contributions on
different processors. The resulting sum of contributions over
\emph{all elements} in \emph{all procesors}.  The sum is available not
only in the master (\verb+rank=0+), but in all processors (as with an
\verb+MPI_Allreduce()+ call).  This is important since this global sum
can be used also in \emph{hooks} in order to perform computations.
For instance, a gatherer can be used to compute the force on a body,
and this force can be passed to a hook to compute the movement of the
body.

\subsection{Creating a gatherer} 

Typically a gatherer is created by deriving from the virtual class
\verb+gatherer+ and implementing the \verb+set_pg_values()+ method
which is in charge of computing the integrands.
