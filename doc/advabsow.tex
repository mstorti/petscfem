\SSSection{Absorbing/wall boundary conditions} 

In some cases we want to have a boundary condition that switches
between absorbing and wall. This is useful for instance for simulating
a sliding hole in a boundary. This kind of b.c. is implemented with
the \verb+gasflow_abso_wall+ elemset. It has properties similar to
that elemset, in particular the \verb+normal+ property.
