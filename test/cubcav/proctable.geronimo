# Script `procsel' generates weigths.dat
# (for Petscfem) and `machi.dat' for MPI
#
# Script `bw <command>' reads it for issuing a
#            command in each processor, for instance
#            `$ bw uptime'
# Script `killfem <string>' kills processes
#            at each node, for instance
#            `$ killfem ns.bin'
#
# If you modify this, please do a `$ make sync' in order to 
#   sunchronize `machi.dat'
