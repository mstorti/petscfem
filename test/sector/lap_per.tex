\Section{Flow in a square with periodic boundary conditions}

This is similar to example ``sector.dat'' but in a region that is the
square $-1<x,y<+1$. $!u$ is imposed on all sides, $|u|=1$ and in the
tangential direction in the counter-clockwise sense, i.e.
$!u=(0,\pm1)$ in $x=\pm1$, $!u=(\mp1,0)$ in $y=\pm1$. By symmetry we
can solve it in $\sfr14$-th of the domain, i.e. in the square $x,y>0$
(We could solve it also in $\sfr18$-th of the region, the triangle
$y>0$, $y<x$, $x<1$).
