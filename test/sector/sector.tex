\Section{Flow in the anular region between to cylinders}

This example tests periodic boundary conditions. The mesh is a sector
of circular strip ( $2.72 < r < 4.48$, $0 < \theta < pi/4$) and we
impose. The governing equation is $\Delta !u=0$, where $!u$ is a
velocity vector of two components.  On the internal radius we impose
$!u=0$ and $!u=!t$ where $!t$ is the tangent vector. On the radii
$\theta=0$ and $\theta=\pi/4$ we impose periodic boundary conditions
so that it is close to flow in the region between two cylinders, with
the internal cylinder fixed and the external one rotating with
velocity 1. But the operator \emph{is not} the Stokes
operator. However in this case the flow for this operator is
divergence free and the gradient of pressure has no component in the
angular direction, so that the solution \emph{do} coincide with the
Stokes solution.

In the output of the test (sector.sal), we check that the solution
is aligned with the angular direction $u_x=-u_y$ at the outlet
section ($\theta = \pi/4$).
